This project is ideal for learning:

- How to develop backend applications using Spring Boot.
- Creating RESTful APIs with Spring MVC.
- Connecting to databases using Spring Data JPA.
- Managing dependencies and configurations with Spring Boot.

---

## Features

- **Spring Boot Framework**: Rapid development with built-in configurations.
- **RESTful API Development**: Well-structured and scalable endpoints.
- **Database Integration**: Uses Spring Data JPA for seamless interaction with databases.
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception handling with proper error responses.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Uses Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring.
- **Dependency Management**: Uses Maven for easy dependency handling.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: The primary framework for development.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project structure.
- **H2**: Database options for persistence.
